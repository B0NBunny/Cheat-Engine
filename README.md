# LATEST UPDATE -- PLEASE READ

After a long duration of side projects, I'm coming back to redo this completely.

I intend to do full scale execution with custom environments using nothing more than cheat engine's Lua Engine,
and on top of that, all of it will operate externally.
I'm going to use every capability that cheat engine has to offer to prove it is still perfectly useful and on-par with today's exploiting standards.






# SCRIPT EXECUTOR GUIDE

Open Cheat Engine.
Hit Memory View.
Press Ctrl+Alt+L, Or Ctrl+L.
Or go to Tools-->Lua Engine.

DO NOT RUN FROM THE CHEAT TABLE...IF THE BUTTON SAYS "Execute Script" UR AT THE WRONG THING.
It should only say "Execute"


Paste everything from script_executor.lua into the text field.

Hit "Execute".

If it loaded up properly, you will see a message in the Dev Console in ROBLOX
saying "Loaded"
Now you can execute lua scripts in your chat bar, like so:

c/print("hello, world!");

c/game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Head:Destroy()

...


# ISSUES

If you're getting kicked at all for using cheat engine, change your cheat engine settings 
to match the 3 screenshots I uploaded here.
Make sure they're as close as possible to the pictures.
And DONT use 'Open Cheat Table' for executing lua scripts



That is all.

Enjoy :)
