# UPDATE LOG

# WORKING AS OF 2/19/22

After a long duration of side projects, I've come back to redo this completely.

In order to run scripts using nothing other than Cheat Engine's own Lua Engine,
you only have to run 1 script -- executor.lua

Go into Memory View and hit Ctrl+L or Tools --> Lua Engine
and paste the script there.

Make any modifications you want to the "rbx_main()" function in executor.lua
which is plainly visible, among the first couple lines.
If you know lua, this should be easy.

Everything in that function will get executed INSIDE ROBLOX.
Now, please note this is still a work in progress and it DOES NOT SUPPORT BIG SCRIPTS YET.



# UNDETECTED CHEAT ENGINE WHEN??

If you're really desparate, contact me at jayyy#8941



# NOTICE

DONT use 'Open Cheat Table' for executing the lua script

That is all. :)
