SCRIPT EXECUTOR GUIDE

Open Cheat Engine.
Hit Memory View.
Press Ctrl+Alt+L, Or Ctrl+L.
Or go to Tools-->Lua Engine.

DO NOT RUN FROM THE CHEAT TABLE...IF THE BUTTON SAYS "EXECUTE SCRIPT" UR AT THE WRONG THING.


Paste everything from script_executor.lua into the text field.

Hit Execute script.

If it loaded up properly, you will see a message in the Dev Console in ROBLOX
saying "loaded"
Now you can execute lua scripts in your chat bar, like so:

c/print("hello, world!");

c/game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Head:Destroy()


Enjoy!




P.S. If you're getting kicked at all for using cheat engine, change your cheat engine settings 
to match the 3 screenshots I uploaded here.
Make sure they're as close as possible to the pictures.
And DONT use 'Open Cheat Table' for executing lua scripts
