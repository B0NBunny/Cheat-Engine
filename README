Here's how to use my bypassed cheat engine:

Download Cheat Engine 7.1

Download "CeleryEngine.exe" from this github and drag it
into the installed Cheat Engine 7.1 folder,
where the original Cheat Engine.exe is.

Run CeleryEngine.exe instead.

You will remain undetected now.

There are 3 images uploaded (jpg's) in this github.
MAKE SURE that your cheat engine settings look as closely as
possible to them, to reduce detection.




SCRIPT EXECUTOR GUIDE

Open Cheat Engine.
Hit Memory View.
Press Ctrl+Alt+L, Or Ctrl+L.
Or go to Tools-->Lua Engine.

DO NOT RUN FROM THE CHEAT TABLE...IF THE BUTTON SAYS "EXECUTE SCRIPT" UR AT THE WRONG THING.


Paste everything from script_executor.lua into the text field.

Hit Execute script.

If it loaded up properly, you will see a message in the Dev Console in ROBLOX
saying "loaded"
Now you can execute lua scripts in your chat bar, like so:

c/print("hello, world!");

c/game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Head:Destroy()


Enjoy!
